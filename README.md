# EXST_7005_Project
The aim of this project is to use statistical methods to determine which race group has the most significant influence on suicide rates in the United States
**Statistical Model:**
**ANOVA (One-way test)**
Analysis of Varience (One way), is a statistical method used to determine any statistically significant differences in the means of three or more independent groups. It essentially compares the means of differenr groups to determine if they are significantly different from each other
**Turkey HSD:**
It is a post hoc test frequently applied in statistical analysis, after conducting ANOVA. This method is designed to identify specific pairs of groups that exhibit statistically significant differences.
**Hypothesis:**
**Ho:** The suicide rates are equal among different racial groups in the USA 
**Ha:** At least one of the  race groups is different to the rest 
**Assumptions:**
  - Independence of observations within the groups
  - Independece of observations between the groups
  - Equality of variances (homoscedasticity): Conducting the Levene Test for Homogeneity of Variance 
  - Normality of the residuals: Applying the KS test (Kolmogorov-Smirnov)
